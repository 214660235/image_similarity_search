EMBEDDING DATASET
1. IMAGE PROCESSING üñºÔ∏è
RESIZE: THE IMAGES ARE RESIZED TO 224X224 PIXELS TO MEET THE MODEL'S REQUIREMENTS.
NORMALIZE: PIXEL VALUES ARE NORMALIZED TO IMPROVE MODEL PERFORMANCE AND ACCURACY.
READY FOR MODEL: THE CLOTHING IMAGES ARE NOW READY TO BE FED INTO THE MODEL FOR VECTOR EXTRACTION.
2. MODEL INITIALIZATION üß†
RESNET50 PRE-TRAINED WEIGHTS: THE RESNET50 MODEL, PRE-TRAINED ON IMAGENET, IS USED TO GENERATE EMBEDDINGS‚ÄîVECTORS REPRESENTING THE ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF THE IMAGES, FACILITATING EASY COMPARISON.
3. SAVING AND LOADING THE DATASET üíæ
BACKUP: IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE A BACKUP. THE VECTORS ARE SAVED AS A FILE AND CAN BE RELOADED FOR FURTHER PROCESSING IF NEEDED.
4. FINDING SIMILAR CLOTHING üîç
COSINE DISTANCE: THE VECTOR OF A GIVEN CLOTHING IMAGE IS COMPARED WITH VECTORS IN THE DATASET TO FIND THE MOST SIMILAR CLOTHING ITEMS.
5. K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS üßë‚Äçüè´
KNN ALGORITHM: THE K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS FOR A GIVEN CLOTHING IMAGE ARE FOUND USING THE NEAREST NEIGHBORS ALGORITHM. THIS ALGORITHM HELPS CLASSIFY OR PREDICT THE CATEGORY OR VALUE OF A NEW SAMPLE BASED ON ITS SIMILARITY TO PREVIOUS SAMPLES.
6. CLUSTERING üìä
KMEANS CLUSTERING: THE CLOTHING IMAGES IN THE DATASET ARE CLUSTERED USING KMEANS, WHICH GROUPS THE SAMPLES INTO SEVERAL CLUSTERS, KEEPING THE INTERNAL PROXIMITY WITHIN EACH CLUSTER.
VISUAL REPRESENTATION: THE CLUSTERS ARE DISPLAYED VISUALLY, ALLOWING YOU TO SEE WHICH IMAGES BELONG TO THE SAME CLUSTER.

HOW TO RUN
INITIALIZE THE MODEL AND DATASET:

python
Copy code
IMGSIM = IMG2VEC(MODEL_NAME='RESNET50', WEIGHTS='IMAGENET')
DATASET_PATH = "/PATH/TO/YOUR/DATASET"
SAVE_PATH = "/PATH/TO/SAVE/EMBEDDINGS"

# EMBEDDING DATASET
IMGSIM.EMBED_DATASET(DATASET_PATH)
IMGSIM.SAVE_DATASET(SAVE_PATH)
LOAD DATASET:

python
Copy code
IMGSIM.LOAD_DATASET(OS.PATH.JOIN(SAVE_PATH, "TENSORS.PT"))
FIND SIMILAR IMAGES:

python
Copy code
TARGET_IMAGE_PATH = "/PATH/TO/YOUR/TARGET_IMAGE.JPG"
SIMILAR_IMAGES = IMGSIM.SIMILAR_IMAGES(TARGET_IMAGE_PATH, N=5)
PRINT("SIMILAR IMAGES:", SIMILAR_IMAGES)
K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS:

python
Copy code
KNN_IMAGES_DETERMINISTIC = IMGSIM.FIND_KNN(TARGET_IMAGE_PATH, K=5, DETERMINISTIC=TRUE)
PRINT("K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS (DETERMINISTIC):", KNN_IMAGES_DETERMINISTIC)
CLUSTERING:

python
Copy code
IMGSIM.CLUSTER_DATASET(NCLUSTERS=6, DISPLAY=TRUE)
CODE STRUCTURE
THE MAIN CLASS, IMG2VEC, HANDLES ALL MAJOR FUNCTIONALITIES:

CLUSTERING AND VISUALIZATION
CONCLUSION
THIS PROJECT ALLOWS YOU TO FIND SIMILAR CLOTHING ITEMS AND CLUSTER THEM USING PRE-TRAINED MODELS AND VARIOUS MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES. IT DEMONSTRATES THE PRACTICAL USE OF DEEP LEARNING MODELS FOR IMAGE PROCESSING AND RETRIEVAL TASKS.
