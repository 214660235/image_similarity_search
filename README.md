# Image Similarity and Clustering with ResNet50

# 1. Image Processing üñºÔ∏è
Resize: The images are resized to 224x224 pixels to meet the model's requirements.
Normalize: Pixel values are normalized to improve model performance and accuracy.
Ready for Model: The clothing images are now ready to be fed into the model for vector extraction.
# 2. Model Initialization üß†
ResNet50 Pre-trained Weights: The ResNet50 model, pre-trained on ImageNet, is used to generate embeddings‚Äîvectors representing the essential features of the images, facilitating easy comparison.
# 3. Saving and Loading the Dataset üíæ
Backup: It's always good to have a backup. The vectors are saved as a file and can be reloaded for further processing if needed.
# 4. Finding Similar Clothing üîç
Cosine Distance: The vector of a given clothing image is compared with vectors in the dataset to find the most similar clothing items.
# 5. K-Nearest Neighbors üßë‚Äçüè´
KNN Algorithm: The K-nearest neighbors for a given clothing image are found using the Nearest Neighbors algorithm. This algorithm helps classify or predict the category or value of a new sample based on its similarity to previous samples.
# 6. Clustering üìä
KMeans Clustering: The clothing images in the dataset are clustered using KMeans, which groups the samples into several clusters, keeping the internal proximity within each cluster.
Visual Representation: The clusters are displayed visually, allowing you to see which images belong to the same cluster.
